# Sync Template

A GitHub Action to sync files from a template repository 
into other repositories.

## Usage

```yaml
name: Sync Template Files

on:
  schedule:
    - cron: '0 0 * * 0'  # Run weekly on Sunday at midnight
  workflow_dispatch:  # Allow manual triggering

permissions:
  contents: write        # Needed to create releases
  pull-requests: write   # Needed to create pull requests
  
jobs:
  sync:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest

    steps:
      - name: Sync Template
        uses: jebel-quant/sync_template@main
        with:
          source: './template.yml'  # Path to your configuration file
          branch: 'sync/update-configs'
          commit-message: 'chore: sync template files'
          token: ${{ secrets.GITHUB_TOKEN }}
```

## Inputs

| Input | Description | Required | Default |
|-------|-------------|----------|---------|
| token | GitHub token or PAT for authentication | Yes | N/A |
| source | Path to the YAML configuration file containing template settings | Yes | N/A |
| branch | Target branch in the current repo | No | sync/update |
| commit-message | Commit message for sync | No | chore: sync template |
| test-mode | If true, skip push and PR creation | No | false |


## How It Works

This action performs the following steps:

1. Checks out the template repository with sparse checkout to only include the specified files/folders
2. Removes excluded files/folders from the template
3. Copies the template files into the target repository
4. Commits and pushes the changes to the specified branch in the target repository
5. Optionally creates a pull request for the changes

The action uses sparse checkout to minimize the amount of data that needs to be downloaded, making it efficient even with large template repositories. 

The pull request creation step uses GitHub's REST API to check if a PR already exists for the branch and creates one if needed. This ensures that multiple workflow runs don't create duplicate PRs.

### GitHub Token Permissions

When using this action to sync workflow files (files in `.github/workflows/`), you need to be aware of GitHub's token permission restrictions:

1. **Default `GITHUB_TOKEN`**: Does not have permission to update workflow files in a repository. If you try to sync workflow files using the default token, you'll get an error like:
   ```
   ! [remote rejected] HEAD -> sync/update (refusing to allow a GitHub App to create or update workflow without `workflows` permission)
   ```

2. **Personal Access Token (PAT)**: To sync workflow files, you must use a PAT with the `workflow` scope. Configure this in your workflow:
   ```yaml
   with:
     token: ${{ secrets.PAT_WITH_WORKFLOW_SCOPE }}
   ```

3. **Repository Settings**: Alternatively, you can modify the default token permissions in your repository settings:
   - Go to Settings > Actions > General
   - Under "Workflow permissions", select "Read and write permissions"
   - Check "Allow GitHub Actions to create and approve pull requests"

The action will automatically detect when workflow files are being modified and provide appropriate warnings.

### Configuration File

The action reads template configuration from a YAML file specified by the `source` parameter. This allows you to maintain template settings separately from your workflow files.

Example configuration file (e.g., `template.yml`):

```yaml
# Required: Repository to sync from
template-repository: 'organization/template-repo'

# Optional: Branch in the template repository (defaults to 'main')
template-branch: 'main'

# Optional: Files and folders to include
include: |
  .github
  .devcontainer
  CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md

# Optional: Files and folders to exclude
exclude: |
  README.md
  LICENSE
```

When using the configuration file:
1. You must specify the path to this file using the `source` parameter
2. The file must contain at least the `template-repository` value
3. Other values (`template-branch`, `include`, `exclude`) are optional

### Include and Exclude Parameters

- **Include**: Specifies which files and folders to sync from the template repository. This uses Git's sparse checkout feature to only download the specified files.

- **Exclude**: Allows you to remove specific files or subdirectories from folders that were included. 
For example, if you include `.github` folder but want to exclude `.github/workflows/sync.yml`, 
you can list this specific file in the exclude parameter. 
This is particularly useful when you want most files from 
a directory but need to exclude a few specific files.

## Testing

The action includes comprehensive testing to ensure it works correctly:

### Automated Tests

1. **Unit Tests**: A bash script (`tests/test-action.sh`) that simulates the action's functionality by:
   - Setting up source and target repositories
   - Performing the sync operations
   - Validating the results with assertions

2. **Integration Tests**: GitHub workflow files that test the action:
   - `.github/workflows/test.yml`: Basic test of the action functionality
   - `.github/workflows/integration-test.yml`: Runs the test script and tests the action in a workflow

### Test Mode

The action supports a test mode that can be enabled by setting the `test-mode` input parameter to `true`. 
In test mode, the action will perform all operations 
except the final git push, making it safe to test 
in CI environments.

Example:

```yaml
- name: Test Sync Template Action
  uses: jebel-quant/sync_template@main
  with:
    source: './template.yml'
    token: ${{ secrets.GITHUB_TOKEN }}
    test-mode: "true"
```

### Running Tests Locally

To run the test script locally:

```bash
chmod +x ./tests/test-action.sh
./tests/test-action.sh
```

## Contributing

Contributions are welcome! Here's how you can contribute:

2. Create a feature branch (`git checkout -b feature/amazing-feature`)
3. Make your changes
4. Run the tests to ensure everything works
5. Commit your changes (`git commit -m 'Add some amazing feature'`)
6. Push to the branch (`git push origin feature/amazing-feature`)
